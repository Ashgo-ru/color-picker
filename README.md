Color Picker 1.0.1
==================

Hello. Thank you for downloading the Color Picker plug-in for Coda 2.

This plugin is a simple alternative to the built-in color picker in Coda 2.

It uses the Apple system-level color panel which you are probably familiar with from using other applications. This panel also allows you to enter numeric values, making it a bit more flexible than Coda's color picker.

With the system-level color panel you get access to the color wheel, Gray Scale, RGB, CMYK, HSB, Crayon pickers and more.

In addition, you can save your favorite colors by dragging them into the color wells at the bottom of the panel.

To use, simply select any color from the panel and the color value will be inserted into the Coda editor. If you set the alpha level, the color value will display as RGBA otherwise it will display hex values.

You can use this plug-in via the Plug-ins menu item in Coda 2 or by pressing Control-Option-Command-C on your keyboard.
